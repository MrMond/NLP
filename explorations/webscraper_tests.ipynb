Make it happen!', 'My two top landing destinations for Butler are the Rockets and Golden State Warriors. I wouldn’t mind these two teams getting into a bidding war to land Butler. Yes, there are risks, but this Rockets team is already really good and in desperate need of what Butler would bring. Acquiring him could be the difference between a first-round appearance and a surprise run to the conference finals.', 'ou’ve had a bit of a downturn the past couple games because of the schedule, but the turnaround looks to be here in the last couple weeks. Keep being fun on offense.', 'Spice up the trade deadline. Trade Jimmy Butler. Bring some chaos into the mix.', 'Do whatever you can to get Norman Powell to the All-Star Game, and if he isn’t selected, let him go on the revenge tour of his dreams.', 'Moving Brandon Ingram needs to happen. I have no idea what you do with Zion Williamson. That doesn’t feel like a deadline deal. It feels like a summer decision. I think Green is still a good coach and believe Griffin still makes good moves. It just hasn’t worked out.', 'Please, don’t be the Hawks again. You’re over .500 this late into the season, and it’s fun. Keep doing the good stuff.', 'before the deadline. Trading for him should’ve never happened, and you need to capitalize on his play the best you can.', 'Jimmy Butler drives past Pistons guard Malik Beasley.

This is the team we expect to see.', 'Force feed Jayson Tatum more so he can really launch himself into future MVP conversations.', 'It sounds so corny, but please get (and keep) Devin Booker, Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal completely healthy. I’m still intrigued by this whole thing.', 'Get Stephen Curry some help. This is ridiculous. Go get Jimmy Butler. Move on from Jonathan Kuminga to do it. You don’t have two timelines. You have now.', ', etc.), and Tatum will probably never have that. And maybe the Celtics are too good and deep to suffer when he’s not on the floor.', 'I hated giving up two first-round picks for Vučević at the time, and I still hate it all these years later. He’s had a very good individual season so far, and the Bulls are pretty decent on the court. But they need to move him for what they can get and keep this youth movement going.', 'Scoot Henderson has been hoopin’ lately, and I want to see as much of him and Shaedon Sharpe in the fourth quarter as possible.', 'rade Nikola', 'I’m not quite sure what it takes because his numbers are really good and the team is super successful. We’re in a land of absurd stat lines for our MVP candidates (Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola', 'Yes, this has nothing to do with basketball because all of the other potential basketball resolutions for this squad involve health.

Thomas is one of those guys, and I am hoping the Nets let him put on a show the rest of the season, especially as they trade away more and more veterans.', 'Give Cam Thomas the ball and get out of the way.', 'No offense to LaMelo Ball, but I want to see a lot more offense going through Brandon Miller.', 'I’m not the only person to suggest this. Some people have been banging this drum since the bad (in my opinion) trade that happened before training camp. Randle would have to swallow his ego in this scenario, and that’s risky to expect.

With that said, I don’t think Porter is going to get any better or more consistent as-is. Bring in LaVine to make things weird.', 'Brandon Ingram slaps hands with Zion Williamson after a play in November.

I hope Doug Christie is successful here because I do enjoy this roster. At some point, though, they need to apologize to Brown for this firing.', 'It doesn’t have to be an either/or situation for the Hornets, who already do run quite a bit of offense through Miller. The second-year pro has been really good, but I wouldn’t mind seeing more of him on the ball.', 'Move Julius Randle to the sixth-man role and start Naz Reid at power forward. It’s time to maximize the offense around Anthony Edwards.', 'I know he’s been bad so far, but I want to see more opportunities for Cody Williams. I think this rookie has real potential, and they need to play him with Lauri Markkanen.', 'Victor Wembanyama has taken 20 shots in a game only 12 times this season. And it’s not because he’s taking a bunch of free throws, although that does happen sometimes. He’s a superstar and one of the best players and scorers in the league already. Force feed him and ride that offensive excellence.', 'I couldn’t help myself with a health-related resolution here after avoiding it with the Sixers. The Suns still don’t have a ton of time on the court with their three stars healthy and available. The trio has played only 12 games together this season. And the offensive rating has been surprisingly awful with the three of them on the court together. It’ll get better, but they need health.', '©2025 The Athletic Media Company, A New York Times Company', 'Is it corny when a group of Thunder players stand behind the postgame interview? Yes. Is it rightly ridiculed on the internet? It seems to be. But can they really make it fun and a better bit? Absolutely. Get some cool jackets to throw on immediately. Maybe the same hat?', 'Start heavily hammering the PR for Santi Aldama as Sixth Man of the Year and Jaylen Wells as Rookie of the Year.', 'I was so high on Williams going into the draft, and he has not delivered. It’s almost incomprehensible how bad he’s been at making shots. But I think getting more reps with the best players on the team will help him a lot. A strong second half should come.', 'Dončić’s injury makes this doable for now, but I have always appreciated what Grimes brings to the table. He’s a good shooter, smart player and a good defender. With Dončić, Kyrie Irving, Klay Thompson and Spencer Dinwiddie, they already have a full backcourt rotation. I just want Grimes to get more chances.', 'This team has been terrible. Some of it has been due to injuries, and some of it has been about the Raptors just not being good. I thought they were competitive for a while, but they recently lost by 54 to Boston. Just give me more 30-point Barrett performances. He’s got eight of them so far this season, and I enjoy when he’s scoring.', 'Make the big trade. Stop pretending you have two timelines to care about.

Enough is enough. You’re supposed to be a gunner! Be a gunner!', 'Heat fans will hate this, but I do want chaos at the deadline. And I think trading Butler will give us the most chaos possible. The Heat can also start retooling their roster with Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro and look for flexibility to add a new star alongside them.', 'I know it’s a bit of a numbers crunch, but I think they’d benefit from using Quentin Grimes a lot more.', 'I’ve been so frustrated with the Hawks since their 2021 conference finals appearance because it felt like they were finally figuring things out, and their success proved to be a fluke. Since then, they’ve been mediocre at best. They’re finally playing winning basketball and matching their talent. Hopefully, this keeps going.', 'I guess this technically makes two? Henderson had really good games against the Utah Jazz and Mavs, reminding everybody why he was so highly regarded. Consistency has been his issue, but I believe in a guy who can get into the paint as easily has he does. And Sharpe is one of the most fun fourth-quarter guys in the league. More of them.', 'I’m really enjoying all these RJ Barrett 30-balls, so let’s get him the ball more.', 'Nobody has scored in the paint like Antetokounmpo this season since Shaquille O’Neal’s 1999-2000 MVP season. Antetokounmpo is averaging 21 points per game in the paint. The 2000 version of O’Neal averaged 22.5 interior points. Ditch the jumpers. Be a monster.', 'I’m not saying either of these guys should outright win these awards, but they should be in the respective running for them. Aldama has been one of the best role players in the league on a great Grizzlies squad. Wells has been one of the better rookies, and Philly’s Jared McCain being out opens up an opportunity. Promote these guys more.', 'The Lakers just landed Dorian Finney-Smith. It was a great pickup, especially for what they gave up. They could still use their first-round picks to land another significant player (maybe even a star). They are not a contending team as currently constructed. The Lakers need to swing for the fences.', 'This is the other spot where I want to see Butler land. Kuminga has been coming on strong lately and used some great performances to try to help them. It’s not really working, though. The Warriors don’t actually have a No. 2 guy. Butler can fix so much of what they want to do while keeping their defensive mentality. You have one timeline: Curry’s. Maximize it.', 'Make Karl-Anthony Towns double his 3-point volume so he’s taking 10 per game instead of five.', 'I want to see them trade for Jimmy Butler before the trade deadline. I need a Butler-Ime Udoka tandem.', 'For the love of god, do whatever exercises and training you have to do to protect your obliques. We want to see Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner back.', 'Ben Franklin 2002 NBA All-Star Game figure', 'The Magic were so resilient and successful without their best player before their second-best player went down with the same injury. We need these two guys healthy for the second half so we can see how good this fully healthy squad is.', 'By Zach Harper', 'It’s always a numbers crunch in the West, and Powell would only be able to make it as a reserve. Coaches might be lazy and vote James Harden over him just for name recognition. But Powell has been excellent.']\n",
